 # Let's learn about list comprehensions! 
 # You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . 
 # rint a list of all possible coordinates given by  a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . 
 # Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.
 #



# All permutations of  are:
# Print an array of the elements that do not sum to .
# Input four integers x,y,c, & n
x= int(input())
